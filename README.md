### `What this is?`
This is a small console app that mimics a lightwieght terminal os just like Debian but without a modern user interface.\
You would think that this is just another terminal emulator, and you would be right, partially because this app will be a little bit more than that.\
And it's inspired by my yellow tabby cat called Mika.

### `Why is this being made?`
Mainly for fun and for some learning experience and the challenge.\

### `Is this open source?`
<strong>YES!</strong> this is open source and you can change this to your hearts content.\
And you are allowed to do whatever is allowed according to the MIT License.\
