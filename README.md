### `What this is?`
This is a small console app that mimics a lightwieght terminal os just like Debian but without a modern user interface.\
You would think that this is just another terminal emulator, and you would be right, partially because this app will be a little bit more than that.\
And it's inspired by my yellow tabby cat called Mika.

### `Why is this being made?`
Mainly for fun and for some learning experience and the challenge.\

### `Is this open source?`
<strong>YES!</strong> this is open source and you can change this to your hearts content.\
You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to redistribute it commercially though.\
Not even the scripts and packages that you have made on it, the point of this project is to be completely free for all users.\
